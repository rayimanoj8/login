This Maven project is a simple Hibernate application that demonstrates basic CRUD operations for user management. The application allows users to create accounts, login, update their details, and logout. The data is stored in a relational database, and Hibernate is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the database.
